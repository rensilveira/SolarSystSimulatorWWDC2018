WWDC 2018 Submission - Solar System Simulator

This project tried to simulate our solar system planets position.

Here you can check where the planets were on an important date, like your birthday!

It is possible to :
  - Remove time parameter
  - Change time speed
  - Set initial date to see planets position on this date
  - Show or hide planet orbit
